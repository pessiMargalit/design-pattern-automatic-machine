# Vending Machine Project
This project simulates the activity of a vending machine for snacks and drinks. It uses five types of Design Patterns.

## Design Patterns
 - Factory Pattern is used to create different types of vending machine products.
 - Singleton Pattern is used to ensure that there is only one instance of the vending machine.
 - Observer Pattern is used to notify listeners when the vending machine's inventory changes.
 - Strategy Pattern is used to determine how to dispense a product, depending on the type of product.
 - State Pattern is used to represent the different states of the vending machine, such as "no coins inserted", "sufficient funds", and "product dispensed".
The project also includes a UML diagram that shows the relationships between the different classes in the project. The diagram is available in the docs folder.

The project is made with WinForm technology. It can be run on Windows 10 or later.

## To Run the Project
 - Open a command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
 - Run the following command: dotnet run
 - The project will start up and you will be able to interact with the vending machine.

## UML Diagram
The following UML diagram shows the relationships between the different classes in the project:
